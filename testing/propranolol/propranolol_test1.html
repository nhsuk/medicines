            <p>Propranolol belongs to a group of medicines called beta blockers. It is used to treat <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Blood-pressure-(high)/Pages/Introduction.aspx">high blood pressure</a>. Taking it helps to prevent future heart disease, <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/heart-attack/Pages/Introduction.aspx">heart attacks</a> and <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Stroke/Pages/Introduction.aspx">strokes</a>. Your doctor may prescribe it to protect your heart after a heart attack.</p>
<p>Propranolol is also used to prevent chest pain caused by <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/angina/Pages/Introduction.aspx">angina</a> and to treat illnesses that cause an <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/arrhythmia/">irregular heartbeat</a>, like <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/atrial-fibrillation/">atrial fibrillation</a>.</p>
<p>Doctors also sometimes prescribe propranolol to prevent <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/migraine/pages/introduction.aspx">migraines</a> and to help with <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Anxiety/Pages/Introduction.aspx">anxiety</a>.</p>
<p>Propranolol can help reduce your symptoms if you have too much thyroid hormone in your body (thyrotoxicosis). You'll usually take it together with medicines to treat an <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/overactive-thyroid-hyperthyroidism/">overactive thyroid</a>. </p>
<p>This medicine is only available on prescription. It comes as tablets, capsules, or as a liquid to swallow.</p>

							<p>Propranolol is a type of medicine called a beta blocker.</p>
                            <p>Like other beta blockers, propranolol works by changing the way your body responds to some nerve impulses, including in the heart. It slows down your heart rate and makes it easier for your heart to pump blood around your body.</p>
							<p>It works differently if you're using it for anxiety. When you are anxious, your brain makes chemical messengers called adrenaline and noradrenaline. These make your heart rate faster and make you sweat or shake. Propranolol helps block the effects of these chemical messengers. This reduces the physical signs of anxiety.</p>

  <section class="o-list-sections__section o-section">
      <h2 class="o-section__header above" id="how-when">How and when to take it</h2>
    <p>Propranolol comes as 2 different types of medicine: standard release and slow release.</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard release - releases propranolol into your body quickly. You may need to take it several times a day depending on your dose.</li>
<li>Slow release - dissolves slowly so you don't have to take it as often. Once a day is usually enough.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>If you are taking it once a day, your doctor may advise you to take your first dose before bedtime, because it can make you feel dizzy. After the first dose, if you don’t feel dizzy, take propranolol in the morning.</span> </p>
<p><span class="c-callout__alert">Keep taking propranolol even if you feel well. You will still be getting the benefits of the medicine.</span></p>
<h3 class="above">How much will I take?</h3>
<p>How much you take depends on why you need propranolol.</p>
<p>Doses for adults and children over the age of 12:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For high blood pressure</strong>, the starting dose is usually 80mg twice a day. If this dose isn't working well enough (if your blood pressure doesn't go down enough), your doctor may increase it to a maximum of 160mg twice a day.</li>
<li><strong>For angina (chest pain) or migraine</strong>, the usual dose is 40mg taken 2 or 3 times a day. This can be increased to 120mg to 240mg a day. Your doctor or pharmacist will explain how to split the dose over the day.</li>
<li><strong>For irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias)</strong>, the usual dose is 10mg to 40mg 3 or 4 times a day.</li>
<li><strong>For anxiety</strong>, the usual dose is 40mg once a day which can be increased to 40mg 3 times a day.</li>
<li><strong>For too much thyroid hormone (thyrotoxicosis)</strong>, the dose is 10mg to 40mg taken 3 or 4 times a day.</li>
</ul>
<p>Doses are usually lower for the elderly or people with a kidney or liver problem.</p>
<p>If your child is under 12 years old and they need propranolol, your doctor will usually use your child's weight to work out the right dose.</p>
<h3 class="above">How to take it</h3>
<p>Propranolol doesn't usually upset your tummy so you can take it with or without food. It's best to do the same each day.</p>
<p>Swallow the tablets whole with a drink of water. If you find them difficult to swallow, some brands have a score line to help you break the tablet in half. Check the information leaflet for your brand to see if you can do this.</p>
<p>If you're taking propranolol as a liquid, it will come with a plastic syringe or spoon to help you measure out the right dose. If you don't have one, ask your pharmacist for one. Don't use a kitchen teaspoon as it won't give you the right amount of medicine.</p>
<h3 class="above">What if I forget to take it?</h3>
<p>If you forget to take a dose of propranolol, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is nearly time for your next dose. In this case, just leave out the missed dose and take your next dose as normal.</p>
<p>Never take 2 doses at the same time. Never take an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.</p>
<p>If you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.</p>
<h3 class="above">What if I take too much?</h3>
<p>An overdose of propranolol can slow down your heart rate and make it difficult to breathe. It can also cause dizziness and trembling.</p>
<p>The amount of propranolol that can lead to an overdose varies from person to person.</p>
<p><span class="c-callout__emergency">If you take too much propranolol by accident, call your doctor or go to your <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/service-search/Accident-and-emergency-services/LocationSearch/428">nearest hospital accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department</a> straight away.</span>If you need to go to hospital, don't drive yourself - get someone else to drive you or call for an ambulance. Take the propranolol packet or leaflet inside it plus any remaining medicine with you.</p>

    <p>Propranolol works as well as other beta blockers for reducing blood pressure. The main difference between propranolol and other beta blockers is that it doesn't just affect your heart. It can affect other parts of your body too, such as your lungs.</p>
<p>There are lots of other medicines to lower your blood pressure and treat chest pain. They work in a different way to beta blockers and include:</p>
<ul>
<li>ACE inhibitors - for example <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/ramipril/">ramipril</a> and <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/lisinopril/">lisinopril</a></li>
<li>angiotensin receptor blockers - for example <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/candesartan/">candesartan</a></li>
<li>calcium channel blockers - for example <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/amlodipine/">amlodipine</a></li>
<li>diuretics (medicines which make you pee more) - for example <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/furosemide/">furosemide</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Beta blockers aren't usually the first choice treatment for <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Blood-pressure-(high)/Pages/Introduction.aspx">high blood pressure</a>. The medicine your doctor prescribes depends on your age and ethnicity.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're under 55, you'll usually be offered an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker.</li>
<li>If you're 55 or older, or you're any age and of black African or Caribbean origin, you'll usually be offered a calcium channel blocker.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes you may have to try other blood pressure-lowering medicines if you get side effects. Many people need to take a combination of different blood pressure-lowering tablets.</p>

    <p>Atenolol, metoprolol, timolol and nadolol are all <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Beta-blockers/">beta blockers</a> and they work well in preventing migraines. However, most doctors prescribe propranolol (also a beta blocker).</p>
<p>There are some other medicines that are known to prevent migraines but they are not officially approved in the UK. They include amitriptyline, sodium valproate and <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/gabapentin">gabapentin</a> and they may have different side effects.</p>
<p>Topiramate can also be used to prevent migraines. It works just as well as propranolol. However, it has not been officially approved for children under the age of 16.</p>

    <p>Propranolol treats the physical symptoms of anxiety - for example, it stops your heart beating too fast. You'll usually only take propranolol for a short time.</p>
<p>Antidepressants like <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medstest/sertraline">sertraline</a> treat the chemical imbalances in the brain that cause these physical symptoms. You usually take antidepressants long term. </p>
<p>Many doctors prefer drug-free treatments. These include talking therapies like <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/">cognitive behavioural therapy</a>. If you're having talking therapy, your doctor may prescribe propranolol at the same time. This will help you with your physical symptoms.</p>

    <p>Like all medicines, propranolol can cause side effects in some people but many people have no side effects or only minor ones.</p>
<p>Side effects often improve as your body gets used to the medicine.</p>
<h3 class="above">Common side effects</h3>
<p>These common side effects happen in more than 1 in 100 people. They're usually mild and short lived.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if the side effects bother you or last more than a few days:</p>
<ul>
<li>feeling tired, dizzy or light headed (these can be signs of a a slow heart rate)</li>
<li>cold hands or feet</li>
<li>difficulties sleeping or nightmares</li>

    <p>Some people on propranolol say they put on weight, especially in the first few months of taking it. However this isn’t a common side effect and there isn’t enough information to say for sure why some people who take it put on weight.</p>
<p>It could, for example, be because propranolol can make you feel tired which could make you less active. It could also affect the way your body uses energy.</p>
<p>If you’re worried about putting on weight with propranolol, speak with your doctor.</p>

<h3 class="above">Serious side effects</h3>
<p>It happens rarely, but some people have serious side effects when taking propranolol.</p>
<p><strong>Tell a doctor straight away if you have:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>shortness of breath with a cough which gets worse when you exercise (like walking up stairs), swollen ankles or legs, chest pain, or an irregular heartbeat - these are signs of heart problems</li>
<li>shortness of breath, wheezing and tightening of your chest - these can be signs of lung problems</li>
<li>yellow skin or the whites of your eyes turn yellow - these can be signs of liver problems</li>
</ul>



<h4>Serious allergic reaction</h4>
<p>In rare cases, propranolol may cause a <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Anaphylaxis/Pages/Introduction.aspx">serious allergic reaction</a>.</p>
<p><span class="c-callout__emergency">A serious allergic reaction is an emergency. Contact a doctor straight away if you think you or someone around you is having a serious allergic reaction.</span></p>
<p>The warning signs of a <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Anaphylaxis/Pages/Introduction.aspx">serious allergic reaction</a> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>getting a skin rash that may include itchy, red, swollen, blistered or peeling skin</li>
<li>wheezing</li>
<li>tightness in the chest or throat</li>
<li>having trouble breathing or talking</li>
<li>swelling of the mouth, face, lips, tongue or throat</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not all the side effects of propranolol. For a full list, see the leaflet inside your medicine packet.<span class="c-callout__info">You can report any suspected side effect to the <a href="https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/">UK safety scheme</a>.</span></p>

    <h3 class="above"><strong>What to do about:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>feeling tired, dizzy or light headed</strong> - as your body gets used to propranolol, these side effects should wear off. If propranolol makes you feel dizzy, sit or lie down until you feel better. Try to avoid alcohol as it will make you feel worse.</li>
<li><strong>cold hands or feet</strong> - put your hands or feet under warm running water, massage them and wiggle your fingers and toes. Don't smoke or have drinks with caffeine in - these can make your blood vessels narrower and restrict your blood flow. Smoking also makes your skin colder. Try wearing mittens (they're warmer than gloves) and warm socks. Don't wear tight watches or bracelets.</li>
<li><strong>difficulties sleeping or nightmares</strong> - try taking your propranolol in the morning. If you have to take it more than once a day, speak to your doctor. They may be able to change your propranolol to the slow release form.</li>
<li><strong>feeling sick</strong> - stick to simple meals and don't eat rich or spicy food. It might help to take your propranolol after a meal or snack.</li>

    <p>Propranolol isn’t thought to be harmful during pregnancy, but it is not possible to be certain. So if you’re trying to get pregnant or you’re already pregnant, talk to your doctor about the benefits and possible harms of taking propranolol. There may be other medicines that are safer for you. </p>
<h3 class="above">Propranolol and breastfeeding</h3>
<p>It is usually safe to take propranolol if you’re breast<span>feeding. This is because only small amounts get into breast milk, which is not enough to cause any problems to your baby.</span></p>
<p>However, speak to your doctor before taking propranolol if your baby was premature or has any health problems.</p>

    <p>There are some medicines that may interfere with the way propranolol works.</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you're taking</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>other medicines for high blood pressure. The combination with propranolol can sometimes lower your blood pressure too much. This may make you feel dizzy or faint. If this keeps happening to you, tell your doctor - they may change your dose.</li>
<li>other medicines for an irregular heartbeat such as amiodarone or flecainide</li>
<li>other medicines which can lower your blood pressure. These include some antidepressants, nitrates (for chest pain), baclofen (a muscle relaxant), medicines for an <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/prostate-enlargement/">enlarged prostate gland</a> like tamsulosin, or <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/parkinsons-disease/Pages/Introduction.aspx">Parkinson’s disease</a> medicines such as levodopa.</li>

<li>medicines to treat nose or sinus congestion, or other cold remedies (including those you can buy in the pharmacy)</li>

<li>non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs), such as <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/ibuprofen-for-adults/">ibuprofen</a>. These medicines may increase your blood pressure, so it’s best to keep them to a minimum.</li>
